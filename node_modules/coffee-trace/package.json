So, while [SourceMaps](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/ \"SourceMaps\") implementation in Coffee-Script is a reality, this is the least I can do.\n\n### Install and Usage\nBecome a masochist by enjoying `uncaughtExceptions` and crashes. Just by installing with:\n  `npm install coffee-trace`\n\nand `require()`ing at the very beginning of your code...\n\n### Utopic Future (High Hopes)\n\n* Testing ( make something crash the way expected )\n* Beautify and comment code\n",
