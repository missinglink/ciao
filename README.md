# Ciao

Ciao is a simple command line utility for testing http(s) requests and generating API documentation.

Scripts are written in coffee-script, however it's important to note that they are interpreted, not executed.

### Basic uptime script:

```coffee-script
#> Check Google is still running
host: 'www.google.co.uk'

#? Should have company name
response.body.should.containEql 'Google'
```

### HTML test script:

```coffee-script
#> Twitter home page
port: 443
protocol: 'https:'
host: 'twitter.com'

#? Login form
$('div.front-signin input#signin-email').length.should.eql 1
$('div.front-signin input#signin-password').length.should.eql 1
$('div.front-signin button[type="submit"]').length.should.eql 1
```

### JSON webservice script:

```coffee-script
#! Requried Headers
headers: 'User-Agent': 'Ciao/Client 1.0'

#> Github API call for node.js README
port: 443
protocol: 'https:'
host: 'api.github.com'
path: '/repos/joyent/node/readme'
headers: 'Accept': 'application/json'

#? Readme is available on Github
response.statusCode.should.equal 200
response.should.have.header 'server', 'GitHub.com'

#? Should be what we are looking for...
json.sha.should.match /^[a-z0-9]{40}/
json.should.containEql
  type: 'file'
  path: 'README.md'
  url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node/contents/README.md'
  html_url: 'https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/master/README.md'
  git_url: 'https://api.github.com/repos/joyent/node/git/blobs/' + json.sha
```

When you run a script, documentation is produced. eg:
[Github API Example - Documentation](https://github.com/missinglink/ciao/blob/master/doc/scripts/examples/github-api.md)

# Writing Scripts

Ciao uses a special syntax to declare the start and end of code blocks.

Currently 4 interpreter directives are supported:

* `#! before` block, this is merged in to every `request` block.
* `#> request` block, this is the main http(s) query definition block.
* `#? assertion` block, this defines a test case which the `result` should conform to.
* `## junk` block, all code in this block will be ignored by the parser.

Each directive is followed by a single space and a directive title

eg. `#> Contact page is available` defines a `#> request` block with the title `Contact page is available`.

The title is used for reporting & documentation, so the better your titles, the easier life will be for you.

# Installing Ciao

To install the most stable `ciao` binary globally on your system via `npm` you can simply:

```bash
$ [sudo] npm install -g ciao
$ ciao --help
```

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/ciao.png?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/ciao)

Note: you will need `node` and `npm` installed first.

The easiest way to install `node.js` is with [nave.sh](https://github.com/isaacs/nave) by executing `[sudo] ./nave.sh usemain 0.10`

# Running Scripts

```
peter@edgy:/var/www/ciao$ ciao --help

  Usage: ciao [options] <file ...>

  Options:
    -h, --help                 output usage information
    -V, --version              output the version number
    -g, --gist [url]           load script from github gist
    -c, --conf [dir]           an additional config file to load after ciao.json
    -s, --silent               disable reporters
    -v, --verbose              report full requests and responses on error
    -d, --documentation [dir]  generate documentation in output dir
```

### Running a single script

```bash
$ ciao scripts/examples/basic.coffee 

 GET http://www.google.co.uk/ scripts/examples/basic.coffee 
 ✓ Status: 200 OK

 GET http://www.google.co.uk/ scripts/examples/basic.coffee 
 ✓ Response.body should contain company name
```

### Running all scripts in a directory

You can also use ciao on directories to recursively run all scripts.

```bash
$ ciao scripts/
```

### Running a gist as a script

You can run remote scripts from github by providing the gist suffix or url.

```bash
$ ciao --gist missinglink/4678610
$ ciao --gist https://gist.github.com/missinglink/4678610
```

Note: The way the gist flag behaves has changed since `0.1.8`, please upgrade if you have issues.

# Requests

The ciao request format is the same as that of the `node.js` native http client `http.request`.

All `#> request` blocks have access to an object named `config` which contains all the static configuration properties defined in the ciao config. (as discussed below)

### Request properties

* `host` A domain name or IP address of the server to issue the request to. Defaults to 'www.example.com'.
* `hostname` To support url.parse() hostname is preferred over host
* `port` Port of remote server. Defaults to 80.
* `method` A string specifying the HTTP request method. Defaults to 'GET'.
* `path` Request path. Defaults to '/'. Should include query string if any. E.G. '/index.html?page=12'
* `headers` An object containing request headers.
* `auth` Basic authentication i.e. 'user:password' to compute an Authorization header.
* `body` If body is an object then `JSON.stringify` will be run on it before sending.

Full `http.request` reference: http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_request_options_callback

### Examples

```coffee-script
#> Post data to a JSON web service
path: '/blog/article'
method: 'POST'
headers:
  'Accept': 'application/json'
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
body: 
  title: 'My amazing blog post'
  body: '@todo'
```

```coffee-script
#> Get package details from the npm registry
host: 'registry.npmjs.org'
path: '/ciao/latest'
headers: 'Accept': 'application/json'

#? Should have preferGlobal set to true
json.preferGlobal.should.be.true
```

---

# Assertions

You can add assertions to your scripts by including `#? assertion` blocks.

Currently `#? assertion` blocks only provide the functionality of the `should` js framework, but I am looking at adding more assertion libraries in the future.

Each test case has access to four objects named `title`, `response`, `json` & `$`.

* `title` is simply the title specified in the interpreter directive (as discussed above)
* `response` contains 3 properties returned by `http.request`
  * `body` contains the body of the http(s) response.
  * `statusCode` contains the status code of the http(s) response.
  * `headers` contains an array of headers that were returned.
* `json` the result of parsing the response.body with `JSON.parse` (empty for invalid json).
* `$` the result of parsing the response.body with `cheerio` (a familiar jQuery-like API).

### Examples

```coffee-script
#? Test the response code
response.statusCode.should.equal 200

#? Test a header is set
response.should.have.header 'server'

#? Test a header value
response.should.have.header 'server', 'apache'

#? Test body contains string
response.body.should.containEql 'Bingo Bango Bongo!'

#? Test body contains regex
response.body.should.match /^[a-z0-9]{40}/

#? Test json object contains properties
json.should.containEql {
  id: "10000000000000000000",
  name: "Bingo Bango Bongo!"
}

#? Check for a redirect
response.should.have.header 'location', 'http://www.example.com/'
```

`should.js` reference: https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js/

### Testing the DOM

Since version `0.1.8` you can test DOM elements in your source using a jQuery-like syntax.

```coffee-script
#> Wikipedia home page
host: 'en.wikipedia.org'
path: '/wiki/Main_Page'

#? Count stylesheets
$('link[rel="stylesheet"]').length.should.eql 2

#? Page structure
$('body.mediawiki > div#mw-page-base').length.should.eql 1

#? Check headers are correctly rendered
$('span.mw-headline').first().text().should.eql "From today's featured article"
$('span.mw-headline').eq(1).text().should.eql "Did you know..."
$('span.mw-headline').eq(2).text().should.eql "Today's articles for improvement"
$('span.mw-headline').eq(3).text().should.eql "In the news"
$('span.mw-headline').eq(4).text().should.eql "On this day..."
$('span.mw-headline').last().text().should.eql "Wikipedia languages"
```

# Project Settings

Ciao looks for a project-wide configuration file called `ciao.json` in your current working directory.

The `defaults` section is merged in to every request that is made, it's useful for specifying global request properties such as `host` and `port`.

The `config` section is useful for storing session tokens or any sort of data you would like available to `#! before` or `#> request` blocks.

Example `ciao.json`

```javascript
{
  "defaults": {
    "host": "www.google.co.uk",
    "port": 80,
    "headers": {
      "User-Agent": "Ciao/Client 1.0"
    }
  },
  "config": {
    "bingo": "bango"
  }
}
```

## Dynamic Project Settings

If you require your settings to be generated before the test suite runs then you may use a file called `ciao.js` or `ciao.coffee` instead of `ciao.json`.

This is particularly useful for running `fixtures` or any other `local` or `remote` code before your tests start.

Dynamic configurations must export their settings with `module.exports` or an error will be thrown.

Note: This feature was introduced in `0.3.1`, please upgrade if you have issues.

# Generate Documentation

Ciao can generate documentation for each `#> request`, the resulting `response` and all `#? assertion` blocks.

The documentation is in `markdown` format and is available in the directory specified using the `-d` flag.

eg. To generate documentation in `./doc` for all scripts in `./scripts`:
```bash
$ ciao -d doc scripts
```

An example generated documentation file can be found here:
[Github API Example - Documentation](https://github.com/missinglink/ciao/blob/master/doc/scripts/examples/github-api.md)

---

## How it works

When parsing `script` & `config` files ciao launches child processes to excute the coffee-script source.
This isolates the main thread from malicious code and ensures the fastest execution of tests.

All the requests are launched asyncronously using `http.request`.

After a `response` comes back from the target server; all `#? assertion` blocks are fired asyncronously in a seperate child process.

## NPM Module
